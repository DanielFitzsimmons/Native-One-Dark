# Native One Dark

There are a couple of great vsCode themes however, I really like the semantic highlighting of the One Dark themes. As a result, ***Native One Dark*** is an attempt to combine a Native MacOS UI visual aesthetic with One Dark semantic highlighting.

## Goals
1. Native MacOS Style UI
2. One Dark Style Semantic Highlighting
